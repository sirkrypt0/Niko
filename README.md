# Niko
Hey, this is Niko, the little robot, intended to be used by teachers and whomever wants to teach programming to kids.  
Its simple interface and easy extendability makes it suitable for all kinds of use cases.

## Installation
**Requirements**: Depending on the version you choose, you need Python 2.7 or Python 3 installed on your PC.

The installation is as simple as going to `distribution/` and downloading the suitable installer for you.  
Right now there is no specific installer for Unix systems, so you have to install the package manually by downloading
the .zip file.  

You can also simply download the niko folder and run the `setup.py` script with suitable parameters to build an installer yourself.
